### Documentation Reorganization and Improvements

- **Changes Made**:
  - Created a centralized `/app/docs` directory for all project documentation
  - Moved all README files from various components into a structured documentation folder
  - Created a master documentation index (Cursor-Readme.md) linking to all other documentation
  - Developed a comprehensive Swiper styling guide with examples and best practices
  - Updated relative links in documentation to maintain proper navigation
  
- **Benefits**:
  - Centralized documentation makes finding information easier
  - Structured organization improves onboarding for new developers
  - Swiper styling guide provides clear patterns for working with complex UI components
  - Improved changelog provides better tracking of project evolution

### Fixed Swiper Loop Warnings

- **Category.tsx**
  - Fixed loop warning by adding duplicate items to the categories array
  - Adjusted `slidesPerView` configuration to prevent loop warnings
  - Added `loopAdditionalSlides` for better loop behavior

- **Testimonial.tsx**
  - Reduced `slidesPerView` from 5 to 3 for desktop to ensure enough slides for looping
  - Reduced `slidesPerView` from 2 to 1 for mobile
  - Added `loopAdditionalSlides` prop set to the number of testimonials

- **Slider.tsx**
  - Added duplicate items to ensure smooth looping
  - Added `loopAdditionalSlides` property
  - Changed `slidesPerView` from fractional (1.2, 1.5) to integer values to avoid warnings
  - Removed `"auto"` slidesPerView for better control

### Fixed Missing `sizes` Prop for Images with `fill` Prop

- **ProductCard.tsx**
  - Added `sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 50vw, 33vw"`

- **ProductGrid.tsx**
  - Added `sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 50vw, 33vw"`

- **Card.tsx**
  - Added `sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 50vw, 33vw"`

- **Gender.tsx**
  - Added `sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 50vw, 33vw"`

- **StyleShapes.tsx**
  - Added `sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 50vw, 33vw"`

- **Product Page**
  - Main product image: Added `sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 50vw, 33vw"`
  - Thumbnail images: Added `sizes="(max-width: 640px) 20vw, 10vw"` for optimal loading

### Improved Error Handling

- **Lenses.tsx**
  - Added `imgError` state to track which images have failed to load
  - Added `handleImageError` function to update the error state
  - Implemented conditional rendering to show placeholder when images fail

- **ProductCard.tsx**, **ProductGrid.tsx**, **Gender.tsx**
  - Added error handling for images with fallback to placeholder
  - Improved error handlers with TypeScript typings

### Added Placeholder Image

- Created a generic placeholder image (400x400) for fallback when images fail to load
- Stored in the correct location at `/frontend/public/placeholder.jpg`
- Ensured all image components reference it correctly as `/placeholder.jpg`

### Fixed Testimonial Component Styling Issues

- **Root Cause**: Swiper library's dynamic manipulation of DOM elements conflicts with Tailwind CSS classes
  - Swiper creates its own scoped styling and wrapper elements that can override or prevent certain CSS classes from applying correctly
  - Conditional class names in template literals don't reliably apply when Swiper renders slides
  - Style transitions between active/inactive states weren't being handled properly

- **Solution Implemented**: 
  - Added a `forceBorders` function that directly applies styles to DOM elements after Swiper initializes
  - Used direct style manipulation for active/inactive state styling which has higher specificity
  - Applied proper transforms, borders, and opacity through JavaScript to ensure styles take effect
  - Connected the style application to Swiper's `onSlideChange` event to update styles as slides change

- **Benefits**:
  - More reliable styling that works consistently across different browsers 
  - Properly distinguishes active slides from inactive ones
  - Maintains visual hierarchy through opacity and transform differences
  - Eliminates flickering or unstyled content during transitions

### Improved Slider Visual Design with Peek Effect

- **Enhancement**: Modified sliders to show partial adjacent slides for better visual appeal
  - Implemented in Slider, Category, and Testimonial components
  - Changed from integer `slidesPerView` to decimal values (e.g., 1.2, 1.5, 3.2)
  - Added responsive breakpoints to adjust the peek amount on different screen sizes
  
- **Features Added**:
  - Visual hierarchy between active and adjacent slides using different opacity and scale
  - Improved styling of adjacent slides to create depth and focus
  - Enhanced mobile experience with peeking slides to encourage interaction
  - Detailed documentation added in `swiper-styling.md` under "Creating Peek Effects" section

- **Benefits**:
  - More engaging and interactive slider experience
  - Visual indication of additional content to encourage exploration
  - Consistent slider appearance across different screen sizes
  - Better alignment with modern e-commerce UX design patterns

## Potential Future Improvements

1. **Image Optimization**:
   - Consider implementing WebP or AVIF format for better compression
   - Add responsive image sets for different device sizes

2. **Performance**:
   - Further optimize Swiper configurations for better performance
   - Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Add more descriptive alt text for images
   - Improve keyboard navigation for carousels 

4. **Documentation**:
   - Add API endpoint documentation
   - Create component prop documentation with TypeScript interfaces
   - Add workflow documentation for common development tasks
